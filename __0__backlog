Todo
====

  Deployment: 
    - Makefile uses standard linux directory for binary, icons
    - Small documentation file explains what this is, how to use

  Features: 
    - Get configuration from configuration files instead of hardcoded
      configuration in configuration.go

  Bugfix: 
    - Histeresis check should account for actuation goroutines may not take the 
      actuator all the way to the desired value in one iteration. 
    - Revert temporary fix: actuate regardless of result of histeresis check
    - If two consecutive identical temperatures are read, errors happen: 
        I| cpuL sampled °C: 56250
        I|   cpuA applies change from 131 to 131: delta=0 sign=-9223372036854775808
        I|   cpuA achieved step rate of 1 steps.s⁻¹
        I|   cpuA equivalent to 1 step of 2 every 1000 ms

  Evaluation: 
    - Find / Write separate program to monitor/log/graph fan speeds, temperature

  Prediction: 
    - Monitor temperature variations during stress tests of varying intensity
      to model temperature evolution as a function of imemdiate temperature and 
      immediate power consumption.

  Features: 
    - Autodetect sensors, etc...


Done
====

  Deployment: 
    - PKGBUILD for integration in pacman
    - make install, systemd service file, .desktop file
    
  Features: 
    - Exit if program is not run as root
    - Proper logging to avoid spamming system journal
    - Use 1/1000th of integers instead of floats
    - Readers/Writer provide/accept standardized units (milliCelsius, milliWatt)
    - Command pipeline reader interface
    - File reader/writer interface
